# Astronomy Picture of the Day Wallpaper Setter

This small script downloads and sets the NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day ([APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)) as wallpaper using NASA's [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#live_example). 
Currently works on Ubuntu 18.04 LTE. Some improvements needed to be done:

1.Explanation of the picture should be sent as a pinned notification.
2.Script should be scheduled to run automatically at every boot of the system.
